It is a text-display Monopoly game with a University of Waterloo Theme that I implemented with my teammate for Object Oriented Porgramming course in UW. The commands are pretty straight forward.You can also view the design UML and the final report we wrote for this game.

DO NOT COPY OR USE OUR CODE. THANK YOU.


Bonus mode:
In order to compile the bonus mode, adding ‘-DBONUS’ in the CXXFLAGS line of Makefile.
In Bonus mode, there is a super boss whose name is “BONNIE”. She has $150000, DC and MC at the beginning of the game.
Whenever BONNIE lands on COOPFEE, she will receive $1500 and receive $2000 when she lands on TUITION.
 The significant part is that BONNIE will attack all the geese in the campus instead of being attacked on Goose Nesting. 
 Also, when every players lands on the COLLET OSAP, he or she can collect $200 more($400 in total).
